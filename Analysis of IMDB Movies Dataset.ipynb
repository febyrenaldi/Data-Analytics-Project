This dataset contains a multitude of insightful details, including movie titles, release dates, runtimes, ratings, voter counts, approval indices, budgets, domestic and international revenues, revenue disparities, and a critical indicator that distinguishes between movie profitability and losses.\n\nIn my analysis, conducted within the SQL environment of Jupyter Notebook, I will embark on a journey to explore the intricate relationship between movie genres and various aspects of the film industry. By utilizing SQL queries and advanced data manipulation techniques, I aim to uncover valuable patterns, correlations, and statistics that can provide deep insights into the world of cinema. My investigation will delve into genre-specific trends, profitability across different genres, audience preferences, budget allocation, and much more.\n\nJoin me as I navigate the cinematic landscape, guided by data, and reveal the captivating narratives concealed within the IMDb Movies dataset, now presented in its long data format.\n\nThe data visualization dashboard (Tableau) and dataset can be accessed at the following link:\n1.
